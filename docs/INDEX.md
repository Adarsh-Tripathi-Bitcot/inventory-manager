## Overview Week - 1

# Inventory Manager

A beginner-friendly Python project to practice Git workflows, environment setup, and core Python programming concepts, including data structures, procedural programming, error handling, and data validation using Pydantic.

---

## Python Concepts Practiced

- Virtual environments (`venv`)
- The Zen of Python (`import this`)
- List comprehensions vs. for loops
- Equality (`==`) vs. identity (`is`)
- Git branching: `main` → `develop` → `feature/week_1`, `feature/week_2`
- Pull Request (PR) workflow for team collaboration


## Overview Week - 2

This week focused on mastering core Python data structures and procedural programming techniques, culminating in a real-world command-line tool to process inventory data from a CSV file.

## Daily Topics & Learnings

### Day 1: Lists & Tuples

- **Lists**: Creation, indexing, slicing, appending, and removing elements.
  - Common methods: `.append()`, `.extend()`, `.pop()`, `.sort()`
- **Tuples**: Syntax, immutability, and use-cases.
- **Key Distinction**:
  - Use **lists** for homogeneous, mutable collections.
  - Use **tuples** for heterogeneous, fixed data (e.g., return multiple values from a function).

---

### Day 2: Dictionaries & Sets

- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs, creation, accessing, updating.
  - Iteration with `.keys()`, `.values()`, `.items()`
- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique items.
  - Use cases: duplicate removal, fast membership testing.
  - **Performance**:
    - Lookup in set: **O(1)**
    - Lookup in list: **O(n)**

---

### Day 3: Control Flow & Functions

- **Control Flow**: `if`, `elif`, `else`, `for`, `while`
- **Functions**:
  - Parameters and return values
  - Applied **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
    - Each function does one thing well
  - Used procedural decomposition for code clarity

---

### Day 4: File I/O & `csv` Module

- **File Handling**: Using `with open(...) as f:` for reading/writing plain text
- **CSV Handling**:
  - `csv.reader`: Basic row parsing
  - `csv.DictReader`: Structured row parsing using headers
- **CSV Pitfalls**: Manual parsing fails with commas in quoted fields

---

### Day 5: Error Handling & Data Validation with Pydantic

- **Error Handling**:
  - `try...except`
  - Specific exceptions: `FileNotFoundError`, `ValueError`, `ValidationError`
- **Pydantic**:
  - Defined `Product` model with type validations:
    - `quantity`: non-negative `int`
    - `price`: positive `float`
  - Caught validation issues and logged errors instead of crashing

---

## Daily Drills

1. **Remove duplicates from a list** using `set()`
2. **Convert list of tuples into a dictionary**:
   ```python
   dict([("Alice", 80), ("Bob", 90)])


# Inventory Manager – Week 3

A continuation of the inventory processor project, this week applies **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and project structuring best practices. The goal is to transform procedural code into a clean, modular, and extensible Python package.

---

## Overview – Week 3

This week focused on understanding and applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to refactor the inventory tool built in Week 2. By organizing code into classes and separating concerns, the project becomes easier to maintain, test, and extend.

---

# Week 4 – Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Pytest

[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-97%25-brightgreen)](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/)

## Overview
This week’s goal was to build strong **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** skills using **pytest**.  
The focus was on:
- Writing tests before implementation (**Red-Green-Refactor** cycle)
- Using fixtures to avoid repeated setup
- Mocking and patching to test code with external dependencies (e.g., file system) without touching real files
- Parameterizing tests to check multiple scenarios efficiently
- Measuring code coverage and understanding its limitations

By the end of the week, I developed a **comprehensive test suite** for the `inventory_manager` package that covers core functionalities of the `Product` and `Inventory` classes.

## ⚙️ How to Set Up & Run

### 1. Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run tests
pytest


4. Run tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=.
```

## Key Concepts Practiced

### 1. TDD (Test-Driven Development)
**Red–Green–Refactor** approach:
- **Red**: Write a failing test  
- **Green**: Write just enough code to make it pass  
- **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests passing  

### 2. Pytest Fixtures
- Created reusable test data (`base_product`, `inventory`, etc.)  
- Reduced repetitive setup code across multiple tests  

### 3. Mocking & Patching
- Used `pytest-mock` to replace:
  - `open()` calls in `load_from_csv` to avoid touching real files  
  - File writing in `generate_low_stock_report`  

### 4. Parametrization
- Applied `@pytest.mark.parametrize` to test multiple inputs in a single function  
- Reduced code duplication in validation error tests  

### 5. Coverage Analysis
- Used `pytest-cov` to measure test coverage  
- Achieved **>95% coverage** for the `inventory_manager` package  

---

## Tools Used
- **Python 3.10+**
- `pytest` – Test framework  
- `pytest-mock` – Mocking/patching support  
- `pytest-cov` – Coverage reporting  
- `pydantic` – Model validation  
- `unittest.mock` – For mocking built-in functions  

---

## End-of-Week Achievements
- Built a full-featured **test suite** for `inventory_manager`  
- Practiced **TDD** by adding a new `get_inventory_value()` method  
- Implemented **mock-based tests** for file I/O without touching disk  
- Improved tests using **parametrization**  
- Achieved **high test coverage** with meaningful assertions  




# Overview – Week 5

# Inventory Manager – Web API with Flask

A continuation of the Inventory Manager project, this week focuses on exposing our inventory functionality as a **RESTful web API** using the **Flask** framework.

---

## Goals
- Understand HTTP fundamentals and REST API principles.
- Use Flask Blueprints to structure API endpoints.
- Implement **CRUD** operations:
  - Create (`POST`)
  - Read (`GET`)
  - Update (`PUT`)
- Validate request data using **Pydantic**.
- Write **integration tests** with pytest and Flask’s test client.

---

## Daily Breakdown

### Day 1 – Intro to APIs & Flask
- Learned the request–response cycle and key HTTP verbs.
- Built a minimal `Hello, World!` Flask app.
- Tested using Postman / Thunder Client.

### Day 2 – Project Structure with Blueprints
- Avoided a monolithic `app.py` by introducing **Blueprints**.
- Created an `api` blueprint for product endpoints.
- Integrated the existing **inventory_manager** package as the business logic layer.

### Day 3 – Read Endpoints
- `GET /api/products` → List all products (JSON).
- `GET /api/products/<product_id>` → Single product details or `404`.

### Day 4 – Create & Update Endpoints
- `POST /api/products` → Validate JSON body, create product, return `201`.
- `PUT /api/products/<product_id>` → Validate JSON body, update product.

### Day 5 – Integration Testing

[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-98%25-brightgreen)](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/)

- Configured **Flask test client** for pytest.
- Wrote request-based tests for all CRUD endpoints in `week_5/tests/test_api_integration.py`.
